<h3 align="center">Overview</h3>

    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project stores information of all the homeless people using 'gofundme' with the Agency. The homeless people are stored 
    into an AVL tree sorted by an ID number given to them by the Agency. Donated funds will be maintained by the Agency with a bankaccount holding all 
    the donations, and when someone wants to withdraw their money, they can ask the agency which will withdraw the requested amount from the bank. 
    Homeless people can only withdraw as much as their donations allow.
